1. Class and Object (Example)
2. Class has data/attributes and funcs/methods.
    -> Attributes are called themselves and funcs are called manually.
    -> Code Walkthrough
3. Why Python is called OOP? -> Everything in Python is an Object (data structure, data type)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own data type.
    > Code Reusability 
    > Debugging
    > Easy to colab
5. End to End Project (Chatbook class implementation)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attributes outside of the class 
    > Encapsulation 
    > getter setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance 
    > Inheritance code example 
    > Why inheritance is needed 
    > What get inherited?
         - Constructor 
         - Non private attributes 
         - Non private methods 
    > constructor overloading & method overloading 
    > Super Keyword 
        - Can only be used inside of class
        - cant access variables or keywords 
        - used only inside child class 
    > Types of inheritance 
        - Single Inheritance 
        - Multilevel inheritance 
        - Hierarchical Inheritance 
        - Multiple inheritance
