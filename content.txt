1. Class and Object (Example)
2. Class has data/attributes and funcs/methods.
    -> Attributes are called themselves and funcs are called manually.
    -> Code Walkthrough
3. Why Python is called OOP? -> Everything in Python is an Object (data structure, data type)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own data type.
    > Code Reusability 
    > Debugging
    > Easy to colab
5. End to End Project (Chatbook class implementation)
    > Encapsulation 
    > getter setter
    > static method
